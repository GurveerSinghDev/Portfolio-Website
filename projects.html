                    <h3>Dissertation</h3>
                    <p>Developed a 2D platformer game that reinforced arithmetic mathematics, simultaneously increasing student motivation through learning by answering MCQ's. 

                        The game was developed using Unity and C#. Utilised PlayFabs API to provide a competitive aspect during gameplay (implemented leaderboards). 
                        
                        Researched academic papers and the current market for educational games which presented opportunities to add functionality. 
                        
                        Implemented scenery, story, leaderboard, music and action to immerse the audience and fulfil the self-determined theory. 
                        
                        Utilised NVivo to analyse data gained from interviews and prepared a descriptive analysis. 
                        
                        The game received positive feedback in reinforcing subjects by participants. </p>

                    <p> Produced a Network diagram between two locations showcasing IP Addresses, Routers, Devices and Roles. 

                        Conducted threat analysis by vector mapping, identifying key threats and their corresponding attack vectors and mapping them to the Mitre Attack Framework. 
                        
                        Conducted a thorough risk assessment to assess possible threats to the CIA Framework. 
                        
                        Created and suggested risk controls, including relevant cybersecurity tools and measures to minimise recognised risks, resulting in improved protection of company assets.</p>
